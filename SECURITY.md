# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We currently support the latest released version of FlexiCalendar. Please update to the newest release before requesting security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, email the maintainers at `security@example.com` with the details so we can investigate and release a fix. We aim to respond within 72 hours.

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce or a proof of concept
- Any known mitigations

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will credit reporters in the release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.
